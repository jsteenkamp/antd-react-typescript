# AntD + React + TypeScript

AntD CSS uses less, this template adds CSS Modules.

CSS Modules can be `.less` or `.css`. 

The advantage of using `.less` is that you can use less syntax and gain module level style scoping.

Using `.css` will keep your CSS in line with the standards. However you will need to add packages to support nesting.
